# Diaphora
Diaphora (διαφορά, Greek for 'difference') is a program diffing plugin for IDA Pro, similar to Zynamics Bindiff or the FOSS counterparts DarunGrim, TurboDiff, etc... It was released during SyScan 2015.

At the moment, it works with IDA Pro but support for Radare2 (and maybe Pyew or even Hopper) is also planned.
For more details, please check the tutorial in the "doc" directory.

## Getting help and asking for features

You can join the mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=es#!forum/diaphora to ask for help, new features, report issues, etc... For reporting bugs, however, I recommend using the issues tracker:  https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora/issues

Please note that only the last 2 versions of IDA will be supported. As of today, it means that only 6.7 and 6.8 are supported. Version 6.6 "should work" (with all the last patches that were supplied to *customers*), but no support is offered for it.

## Documentation

You can check the tutorial https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora/blob/master/doc/diaphora_help.pdf

Install Diaphora into your Python packages:

    $ python setup.py install

Or, if you're using a version of IDA with an older version of Python:

    $ python2.6 setup.py install

In IDA you can then load diaphora from the Python prompt:

    > import diaphora;diaphora.main()
